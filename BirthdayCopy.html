  <h1>Happy Birthday</h1>
  <p>
    Happy Birthday to someone truly special. On this day, I just want to thank you for being the kind of person who brings light and comfort without even trying.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ve always had this quiet strength, this warmth that doesn’t ask to be noticed but always is. I admire that. I hope you take today to rest, smile a little more, and celebrate yourself the way you deserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Know that no matter how busy or quiet life gets, you’re someone I will always hold with care and appreciation. This small message is just a reminder—you are seen, valued, and deeply appreciated.
